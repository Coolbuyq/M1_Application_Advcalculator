# Requirements

## Introduction
Our project is smart calculator that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponent like exponential operations,  logarithm s, trigonometric functions, and modulus.

## High level Requirements

| ID | Description | Status (Implemented) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HR01 |System ought to be capable of get right of result of arithmatic operation | Implemented |
| HR02 | User ought to be capable to handle all function by specific numeric keys | Implemented |
| HR03 |System ought to understand floating and integer numbers  | Implemented |
| HR04 |system ought to capable in giving result in floating numbers | Implemented |
| HR05 |System ought to understand invalid credentials | Implemented |



## Low level Requirements

| ID | Description | Status (Implemented) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LR01 |System can give result of maximum 12 functions | Implemented |
| LR02 |invalid operation should be properly reported as such  | Implemented |
| LR03 |calculation should be perform within milisecond | Implemented |
